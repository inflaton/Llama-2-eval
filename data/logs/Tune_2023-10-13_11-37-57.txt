Hippocrates is widely considered to be the Father of Medicine. His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled.

Generally speaking, a whole chicken can be stored in the freezer for up to one year, while chicken pieces should be used within six to nine months. It's important to note that even though the chicken may still be safe to eat after the recommended storage time, its quality may start to degrade, leading to changes in texture and flavor.

The temperature of your freezer is affected by how full your freezer is, how well you maintain it (keeping it from icing up) and the quality of your freezer. If your freezer is constantly at or below -18°C and the chicken was bought frozen tests have shown little measurable change at 12 months.

The best and safest way to thaw meat is to place the frozen package in the refrigerator and let it thaw gradually. Small cuts will thaw this way in about 24-hours while larger cuts can take a few days. If you're rushed for time, small cuts can also be thawed in a bowl of lukewarm water under running water. Two things not to do are thaw frozen meats on the counter or cook them straight from the freezer.

However, freeze chicken immediately if you do not plan to use it within two days after purchasing. You can freeze most chicken in its original packaging safely for up to two months; if you plan to freeze it longer, consider double-wrapping or rewrapping with freezer paper, aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Stocking the freezer with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs can be a real timesaver.

Thawing times for frozen chicken can vary depending on how thoroughly frozen the chicken is and whether the chicken is whole or cut up. A general guideline is to allow 24 hours thawing time for a 5-pound whole chicken; allow about 5 hours per pound for thawing chicken pieces.

Placenta accreta is a serious pregnancy condition that occurs when blood vessels and other parts of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterine wall. Typically, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth. With placenta accreta, part or all of the placenta remains firmly attached.
 Source: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/placenta-accreta/basics/definition/CON-20035437
This can cause severe blood loss after delivery. It's also possible for the placenta to invade the muscles of the uterus (placenta increta) or grow through the uterine wall (placenta percreta). Placenta accreta is considered a high-risk pregnancy complication. If placenta accreta is suspected during pregnancy, you'll likely need an early C-section delivery followed by the surgical removal of your uterus (hysterectomy).

The placenta grows in your uterus (womb) and supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Normally, the placenta grows onto the upper part of the uterus and stays there until your baby is born. During the last stage of labor, the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus, and your contractions help push it into the vagina (birth canal). This is also called the afterbirth.

{'question': "how long does a woman's cycle last", 'chat_history': []}
It depends on various factors such as age, overall health, stress levels, etc., so there isn't really a standard duration for a woman's cycle. However, according to studies, the average length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 21 to 35 days, with most women experiencing cycles around 28 days long.

During pregnancy, the menstrual cycle stops. How long does a menstrual cycle last, can be better understood once you will find out if you have a normal cycle or not. If you get your menses started on the first of last month then you should get it on first of this month or two days before or after it. This is considered as a normal menstrual cycle.
 Source: http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/understanding-ovulation/
This first half of the cycle can differ greatly for each woman lasting anywhere from 7 days until 40 days. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins.
 Source: http://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/how-long-does-ovulation-last
A normal ovulation cycle lasts for about 24 hours each month. Once an egg is released from an ovary, it will die or dissolve within 12 to 24 hours if it’s not fertilized. If fertilization doesn’t occur, the egg and your uterine lining will shed. This results in menstrual bleeding about two weeks later.

Men's health. Women's health. The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average is to have periods every 28 days. Regular cycles that are longer or shorter than this, from 24 to 35 days, are normal.
 Source: http://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/understanding-ovulation/
On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. Most women ovulate anywhere between Day 11 – Day 21 of their cycle, counting from the first day of the LMP.

Menstrual cycle occurs after a month; it occurs in between twenty one to thirty five days. Increasing or decrease in weight is also a result of irregularity in menstrual cycle. When woman, who are not willing to have a baby, do sexual intercourse and take birth prevention pills suffer irregularities in menstrual cycle.

The menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of menstrual bleeding, Day 1, up to Day 1 of your next menstrual bleeding. Although 28 days is the average cycle length, it is normal to have a cycle that is shorter or longer. A teen's cycles may be long (up to 45 days), growing shorter over several years. Between ages 25 and 35, most women's cycles are regular, generally lasting 21 to 35 days.
 Source: https://www.zocdoc.com/answers/7527/how-long-is-a-womans-menstrual-cycle
The typical length for the menstrual portion of the cycle is 3-5 days. This is the portion of the 28 day cycle in which bleeding occurs. Thus, 2 weeks is a bit long for someone to be on their period. There can be several reasons for this. If this was a one time thing, then the cause will probably never be found.

On Day 1 of your cycle, the thickened lining (endometrium) of the uterus begins to shed. You know this as menstrual bleeding from the vagina. A normal menstrual period can last 4 to 6 days. Most of your menstrual blood loss happens during the first 3 days.

The first day of your menses – or period – is day 1 of your cycle and the start of the follicular phase. During this phase, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a female sex hormone, is released from the brain to stimulate the development of a single dominant follicle which contains one egg.

Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity (L T −1), facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c.

Joule is the unit of energy used by the International Standard of Units (SI). It is defined as the amount of work done on a body by a one Newton force that moves the body over a distance of one meter.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt
Like the elementary charge on which it is based, it is not an independent quantity but is equal to 1 J/C √2hα / μ0c0. It is a common unit of energy within physics, widely used in solid state, atomic, nuclear, and particle physics.
 Source: http://www.universetoday.com/61490/what-is-a-joule/
Conversely, work done on a body changes the energy of the body. Let’s go back to the apple example mentioned earlier to elaborate. An apple is a favorite example to illustrate a one joule of work when using the definition given earlier (i.e., the amount of work done ….) because an apple weighs approximately one Newton.
 Source: http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-joule.htm
The joule is a unit of measure for energy. Sitting quietly, a person generates 100 J of heat every second. Individuals pay per kilowatt hour for the electricity they use in their homes. The amount of energy required to lift an apple 1 meter (3.3 feet) is roughly equivalent to 1 Joule.
 Source: http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-joule.htm
Examples. To get an idea of how much energy a joule actually is, it helps to look at some everyday examples. A joule is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of cool, dry air by 1.8°F (1.0°C). An average person sitting quietly produces 100 J of heat every second. The amount of energy required to lift a small apple 1 meter (3.3 feet) against the Earth's gravity is roughly equivalent to 1 J.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt
In physics, the electronvolt (symbol eV; also written electron volt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately 160 zeptojoules (symbol zJ) or 6981160000000000000♠1.6×10−19 joules (symbol J).
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt
In high-energy physics, the electron volt is often used as a unit of momentum. A potential difference of 1 volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., 6981160217648700000♠1 eV).

In particle physics, a system of natural units in which the speed of light in vacuum c and the reduced Planck constant ħ are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: c = ħ = 1.

At the top, the apple would have gained about one joule of potential energy. Also, when the apple is one meter above its original position, say the floor, gravity would have gained the ability to do work on it. This ability, when measured in joules, is equivalent to one joule. Meaning, when you release the apple, the force of gravity, which is simply just the weight of the body and equivalent to one Newton, would be able to perform one joule of work on it when the apple drops down from a height of one meter. Mathematically, 1 joule = 1 Newton ⋅ meter.

Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as major, and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

At the end of the Frasnian Age in the later part(s) of the Devonian Period, a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species. This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 Ma, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.

Best Answer: There have been 5 Mass Extinction events in Earth's history. They are. 1.Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event (End Cretaceous or K-T extinction): 65.5 Ma at the Cretaceous.Maastrichtian-Paleogene.Dania... transition interval. The K–T event is now called the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event by many researchers.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event
The most recent and debatably best-known, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time.

Once hatched, both the male and female will feed the young.

According to the article, adult men need around 56 grams of protein per day while adult women require approximately 46 grams of protein each day. However, these values may vary depending on individual factors such as age, weight, and physical activity levels.

In fact, Canadian researchers found that 20 grams of protein every three hours four times a day was better at helping men build lean body mass than eating smaller amounts more often (10 grams of protein eight times a day) or larger amounts less frequently (40 grams of protein twice a day).

For strength athletes, those numbers are even higher--generally between 0.7 and 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight, he says. If you've been shooting for a gram of protein per pound of body weight--or more--you're overdoing it.

If your cache of carbs is low, your body will use protein as an alternate fuel source, and your muscles won't grow as much as they would if you were feeding them a cocktail of protein and carbs. As for the fat, it's vital for the production of muscle-building testosterone.
 Source: http://www.webmd.com/diet/healthy-kitchen-11/how-much-protein
But the truth about protein is that many people don't need as much as they are taking in. Adults in the U.S. are encouraged to get 10% to 35% of their day's calories from protein foods. That's about 46 grams of protein for women, and 56 grams of protein for men. It's not hard to get this amount if you eat two to three servings of protein-rich foods a day, according to the CDC. 1  A small 3-ounce piece of meat has about 21 grams of protein. 2  One 8-ounce container of yogurt has about 11 grams of protein. 3  One cup of milk has 8 grams of protein. 4  One cup of dry beans has about 16 grams of protein.

Yes--if you aren't getting the amount of protein your body requires based on your activity level. You can check nutrition labels and add up grams of protein on your own, or just remember the numbers 1, 5, 10, 15, 25 to roughly estimate protein intake.

Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers. Protein is essential for maintaining and building muscle, but you don’t need to gulp down a carton of raw eggs like Rocky to get the maximum benefit. Consuming 20 grams of protein after your workout should do the trick, report British researchers. In the study, 48 men ingested zero, 10, 20, or 40 grams of protein immediately after a strength workout. The 20-gram and 40-gram doses more effectively stimulated muscle protein synthesis—the process that helps promote the muscle repair and growth after exercise—in participants than the lower amounts.

You need protein for your muscles, bones, and the rest of your body. Exactly how much you need changes with age: 1  Babies need about 10 grams a day. 2  School-age kids need 19-34 grams a day. 3  Teenage boys need up to 52 grams a day. 4  Teenage girls need 46 grams a day. 5  Adult men need about 56 grams a day.

And more. So, here’s the daily protein recommendations you need to know: 1  If you do NOT workout and do NOT have any real diet or fitness related goal (like building muscle, losing fat, etc.), you should eat between 0.5-0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day.
 Source: http://www.intense-workout.com/protein_per_day.html
Meaning, they’d need to eat between 90-126 grams of protein per day in this example. And a 180lb person who DOES work out and IS trying to build muscle or lose fat would do 180 x 0.8-1.5 and get 144-270. Meaning, they’d need to eat between 144-270 grams of protein per day in this example.

Most people already know this, which is why “how much protein do I need daily” and “how many grams of protein should I eat per day” are questions I get asked damn near every single day. Well, if you’ve ever asked yourself that same type of question, you’re in luck.

The Shannon number, named after Claude Shannon, is a conservative lower bound (not an estimate) of the game-tree complexity of chess of 10120, based on an average of about 103 possibilities for a pair of moves consisting of a move for White followed by one for Black, and a typical game lasting about 40 such pairs of moves.

FYI: How Many Different Ways Can a Chess Game Unfold? Almost nothing looks more orderly than chess pieces before a match starts. The first move, however, begins a spiral into chaos. After both players move, 400 possible board setups exist. After the second pair of turns, there are 197,742 possible games, and after three moves, 121 million. At every turn, players chart a progressively more distinctive path, and each game evolves into one that has probably never been played before.

This is how a computer looks at chess. It thinks about it in a world of all possible moves, and it makes a big tree for all of those moves, like this: In this tree, there are 20 possible moves for white. There are 20 * 20 = 400 possible moves for black, depending on what white does.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number
This includes some illegal positions (e.g., pawns on the first rank, both kings in check) and excludes legal positions following captures and promotions. Taking these into account, Victor Allis calculated an upper bound of 5×1052 for the number of positions, and estimated the true number to be about 1050.
 Source: http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/chess1.htm
Now white can move again. This next move depends on the first move that white chose to make, but there are about 20 or so moves white can make given the current board position, and then black has 20 or so moves it can make, and so on. This is how a computer looks at chess. In this tree, there are 20 possible moves for white. There are 20 * 20 = 400 possible moves for black, depending on what white does. Then there are 400 * 20 = 8,000 for white.

The number of possible chess positions after White’s first ply move is 20 (16 pawn moves and 4 knight moves). There are 400 possible chess positions after two ply moves (first ply move for White followed by first ply move for Black). There are 5,362 possible positions (White’s second ply move) or 8,902 total positions after two ply moves each. There are 71,852 possible positions or 197,742 total positions after four moves. There are 809,896 possible positions or 4,897,256 total positions after 5 moves.There are 9,132,484 total positions after 6 moves.

According to Focus Magazine, the average human bladder can hold about 400 to 600 milliliters of urine. The average person produces about 1,500 ml of urine every 24 hours, so it only takes nine or 10 hours before you're filled up and you've gotta go — bad.

How many ounces can your bladder hold? The bladder serves as a holding area for urine and is located in the pelvic region of the body. Urine is produced in the kidneys and then travels through the ureters to the bladder. Spokane Urology reports that urine continually builds in the bladder until it is emptied. Nerves within the bladder send signals to the brain when it has reached its limit, which causes the urge to urinate.

A key difference between a psychopath and a sociopath is whether he has a conscience, the little voice inside that lets us know when we’re doing something wrong, says L. Michael Tompkins, EdD. He's a psychologist at the Sacramento County Mental Health Treatment Center. A psychopath doesn’t have a conscience. If he lies to you so he can steal your money, he won’t feel any moral qualms, though he may pretend to. He may observe others and then act the way they do so he’s not “found out,” Tompkins says. A sociopath typically has a conscience, but it’s weak.

Double-click the cell with the formula or press F2 to edit it. Position the insertion point somewhere on the reference you want to convert to absolute. Press F4. When you finish editing, click the Enter button on the Formula bar and then copy the formula to the messed-up cell range with the fill handle.

If you do not want cell references to change when you copy a formula, then make those cell references absolute cell references. Place a $ before the column letter if you want that to always stay the same. Place a $ before a row number if you want that to always stay the same.

Relative Reference. By default, Excel uses relative reference. See the formula in cell D2 below. Cell D2 references (points to) cell B2 and cell C2. Both references are relative. 1. Select cell D2, click on the lower right corner of cell D2 and drag it down to cell D5. Cell D3 references cell B3 and cell C3.
 Source: http://web.pdx.edu/~stipakb/CellRefs.htm
Usually the CELL REFERENCES will CHANGE! If you copy a formula 2 rows to the right, then the cell references in the formula will shift 2 cells to the right. If you copy a formula 3 rows down and 1 row left, then the cell references in the formula will shift 3 rows down and 1 row left.

A relative cell reference adjusts to its new location when the formula is copied or moved. An absolute cell reference does not change when the formula is moved. Select the cell that contains the cell reference that you want to change. In the formula bar, click the cell reference that you want to change. Press + T to move through the combinations. In the following table, the Changes to column reflects how a reference type updates if a formula that contains the reference is copied two cells down and two cells to the right.

To stop Excel from adjusting a cell reference in a formula in any copies, convert the cell reference to absolute. To do this, press the function key F4, after you apply Edit mode (F2). You make the cell reference absolute by placing dollar signs in front of the column letter and row number.

When turkey is cooked with direct heat on a charcoal grill, the lit coals are usually spread in an even layer on the bottom of the grill. This provides a consistently hot, even temperature under the entire cooking surface. The cooking temperature typically reaches 450ºF to 650ºF when grilling over direct heat. Thin cuts of meat are grilled quickly over such high temperatures and should be turned only once to cook both sides. Thinly sliced turkey breast cutlets and ground turkey burgers are perfect choices for direct heat grilling.

{'question': 'how long to cook sirloin steak', 'chat_history': []}
Sirloin steak can be cooked in various ways such as grilling, pan-searing, or oven roasting. The recommended cooking time will depend on the thickness of the steak, the heat source used, and personal preference regarding doneness. Here are some general guidelines for cooking sirloin steak based on the thickness of the steak:
* For a 1-inch thick steak, cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-well done, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium, and 1 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.
* For a 1.5-inch thick steak, cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-well done, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium, and 2 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
* For a 2-inch thick steak, cook for 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-well done, 6 to 9 minutes per side for medium, and 4 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare.
It's essential to use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak during cooking to ensure food safety and optimal tenderness. The USDA recommends cooking beef to an internal temperature of at least 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare, 160°F (71°C) for medium, and 170°F (77°C) for well-done.

This way you'll have zero speed when you get there. So: for the first half lightyear, s (distance) = (a/2) * t^2 = 5 t^2. So when you know s in meters (c=299792458m/s), divide by 5, take the square root and there's your time in seconds. There's half the journey; double it for the whole one.

The dimension of the manifold at a certain point is the dimension of the Euclidean space that the charts at that point map to (number n in the definition). All points in a connected manifold have the same dimension. Some authors require that all charts of a topological manifold map to Euclidean spaces of same dimension.

A manifold may be endowed with more structure than a locally Euclidean topology. For example, it could be smooth, complex, or even algebraic (in order of specificity). A smooth manifold with a metric is called a Riemannian manifold, and one with a symplectic structure is called a symplectic manifold.

Step Three: Grilling the Salmon. Prepare the grill for direct grilling at 500ºF. once hot, clean the grill surface with a sturdy grill brush. For filets that are 1-inch thick, we grill the salmon for a total of about 8 minutes over a 500ºF fire. This should result in fish that is cooked medium to medium-well. Place each filet on the grill grate directly over the fire with the skin-side up. After about 5 minutes, the edges of the meat should begin to pull away from the grill. The salmon will release from the grill when it is ready to turn over. A few exploratory lifts at the edges should tell you whether or not it is ready.

{'question': 'biology definition of barr body', 'chat_history': []}
Barr body refers to the densely staining nucleoprotein structure formed around an inactive X chromosome in female mammalian somatic cells (not germ line). It results from random X chromosome inactivation early in embryonic development, leading to mosaicism throughout life.






***Answer:
Barr body refers to the densely staining nucleoprotein structure formed around an inactive X chromosome in female mammalian somatic cells (not germ line). It results from random X chromosome inactivation early in embryonic development, leading to mosaicism throughout life.

Sources:

Barr body testing is a test to determine the presence of multiple X chromosomes in a cell. When more than one X chromosome is present in a cell, only one X is allowed to remain active, and any excess X chromosomes are randomly inactivated and condensed. The condensed, inactivated X chromosome is called a Barr Body.
 Source: http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/barr_body.html
Barr Body. Transcriptionally dormant X chromosome as found within individuals possessing more than one X chromosome. Such individuals, of course, usually are female but also can be Klinefelter syndrome males.
 Source: http://en.mimi.hu/biology/barr_body.html
Barr body. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Jump to: navigation, search ... Barr body. In those species in which sex is determined by the presence of the Y or W chromosome rather than the diploid y of the X or Z, a Barr body is the inactive X chromosome in a female cell, or the inactive Z in a male. Barr body Inactivated X-chromosome in mammalian females.
 Source: http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/barr_body.html
The reason for the formation of the Barr body is one of dosage compensation, which is to say that most of the genes associated with the X chromosome are expressed to an appropriate extent when found in a single copy, i.e., as one sees in males.
 Source: https://societyandgenetics.wordpress.com/spring-2013/testing-sex-for-competitive-sports/weapons/barr-body-testing/
The cells on the left, taken from a man, do not exhibit any Barr Bodies. The cells on the right, taken from a woman, exhibit one Barr Body per cell. Pros: Barr Body testing was used by both the IOC and the IAAF beginning in 1968.
 Source: http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/barr_body.html
Which X chromosome is converted to a Barr body occurs randomly during embryo development and can be a different X chromosome in different tissues. Once converted, the Barr body retains that status through mitotic divisions. Females, as a consequence, are considered to be mosaics with regard to X chromosome inactivation, with some tissues expressing one X chromosome and different tissues the other.
 Source: https://societyandgenetics.wordpress.com/spring-2013/testing-sex-for-competitive-sports/weapons/barr-body-testing/
Each excess X chromosome will form one Barr body. This means that 46,XX women will have cells that exhibit one Barr body, while the cells from a 46, XY male will not exhibit any Barr bodies.

Tipping the scale. Your weight is a balancing act, but the equation is simple: If you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound. So, in general, if you cut 500 calories from your typical diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories).

In some states, a homeowner may not receive any notification of a non-judicial foreclosure until the sale is scheduled. In California, according to the Paladin Legal Advocacy Center, your lender must notify you within 10 days of filing a notice of default with the county recorder. The trustee can't schedule the sale until three months after the filing. The trustee must advertise the sale in the newspapers 20 days in advance, so it will be close to four months from the filing to the foreclosure auction.

As noted in my title, I give the Johnsonville links a 5* review. I'm a bit of a sausage snob and the other brands disappoint and pale in comparison!

However, generally speaking, the average summer temperature in Iran ranges between 39°C (102°F) to 45°C (113°F) during the months of June, July, and August. Some areas like the coastal regions may experience slightly lower temperatures due to their proximity to the ocean, but overall, these three months tend to be the hottest times of the year across much of Iran. I hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

The high reached 52.8 C (127.0 F) at Mitribah, Kuwait, on July 30. So far that is the highest temperature in Kuwait during this heat wave. According to Herrera, the national heat records for both Iraq and Iran are both 53.0 C (127.4 degrees F) set in a heat wave at this time of year in 2011. The hottest temperature in Iraq in this heat wave was in Kanaqin, where the high on July 30 hit 52.0 C (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The capital, Baghdad, wasn't far behind at 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 degrees Fahrenheit); this appears to have tied the modern all-time record high for that city.

First, you’ll use far fewer studs. Here’s an easy way to determine approximately how many you’ll save: number of studs saved=lineal feet of wall*0.25. As an example, say you’re building a 50-foot-by-50-foot, one-story house. The total length of exterior wall is 50*4=200 lineal feet. Let’s assume there are 100 lineal feet of interior wall.

Use the repeating measurement to help project the location of the next stud. The 16 inch (40.6 cm) centered studs will be found at 16, 32, 48 etc. from nearly any stud found. Likewise, the 24 inch (61.0 cm) centered studs will be found 24, 48, 72 etc from nearly any stud found. Places where the distance may be less than the 16 or 24 multiplier can occur at wall corners, doorways and windows.

As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started to look and sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in brass bands, concert bands, and in specific orchestral repertoire that requires a more mellow sound. The name cornet derives from corne, meaning horn, itself from Latin cornu. While not musically related, instruments of the Zink family (which includes serpents) are named cornetto or cornett in modern English to distinguish them from the valved cornet described here.

In addition to the kitchen faucet, you'll also find faucets in the bathrooms. In fact, most bathrooms will have a faucet in the sink and one in the shower or bathtub. Not all faucets are the same, though. Some may have two handles: one for cold water and one for hot water. Other faucets may consist of one handle that you keep turning in one direction to make the water hotter. When you turn on a faucet, water comes out . This is because there is always water running through the plumbing system in your house.
 Source: http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-do-faucets-regulate-water-temperature
The faucet handles themselves, though, don't control the temperature of the water. Faucets are supplied with water from two different water lines, one cold and one hot. The hot water line usually comes from a heat source called a hot water heater.

Since it is you who wants to have a very cold shower, you decide what temperature you can stand, I personally wouldn't go for such cold water but those people going for a New Year's dip often in icy lakes do that yearly, so it clearly isn't lethal.

Platelets hold a unique power to save lives. Cancer patients are a primary recipient of platelets due to the harsh effects of chemotherapy. Platelet donations are done using a process called automation (sometimes referred to as apheresis). Automation allows us to collect specific components of your blood at a larger volume. For example, one automated platelet donation produces one or more complete platelet doses for a patient. It would take six to eight whole blood donors pooled together to produce one complete platelet dose. People with the following blood types should consider donating Platelets.

{'question': 'how long can you keep tea', 'chat_history': []}
It depends on the type of tea and how well you store it. In general, black tea can last up to 2 years, green tea around 1 year, and herbal tea about half that time. However, these estimates vary depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and whether the tea has been exposed to light.

A storage canister can slow oxidation and allow tea bags a longer shelf life. To keep moisture, oxygen and rival smells away from your tea bags, place them in an airtight, preferably metal, container and away from sunlight, heat and high humidity. This may keep the tea fresh for up to two years. An exception to this guideline pertains to the aged Keemun and Pu-erh teas, which like wine require oxygen — but not heat and moisture — to continue to mature. A fermented tea made from a leaf grown in Yunnan in China, pur-erh tea can stay fresh for up to 50 years. Tea purveyors came up with the six-month guideline for best results, but if you aren’t picky and don’t want to waste tea bags, you may be able to store them for up to two years.

I see above that it is recommended to keep iced tea no longer than 8 hours, but it does not say the word “refigerated,” so I assume that probably means just sitting out in an urn, like they often do at restaurants.

First of all, you'll need to store the tea bag in a moist medium. Once they get dried out, they become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. So your best bet is to store them in a small shot glass filled with water. That will keep them seeping while they are being stored. While you can leave them out in your kitchen, I usually put them in the fridge so that there is less chance of bacteria growth. If you think you've got bacteria or mold in your tea bag, the best indicator is smell. If it smells funky, trash it. A tea bag can be reused one or two times. After that, it's spent. Reusing green or white tea works better than darker blends. I usually reuse Orange Pekoe tea bags because I use two bags in one cup: I like strong milk tea in the mornings, with milk, no sugar.

In fact, if you search the phrase “sun tea” on their site, there are no pages. I suspect that someone identified the max temp that sun tea achieves, and identified some kind of bacteria that could feasibly survive in water that long.

If you don’t notice a difference in flavor when you keep tea in the fridge for longer, then by all means keep it for as long as it tastes good to you. With one caveat: it’s probably only safe to keep it for a week at the most. I’m not an expert on bacteria growth in tea, but a week is generally how long most prepared foods can be kept in the fridge before discarding them. When you keep tea in the fridge, make sure you keep it in a tightly sealed container so that it doesn’t absorb flavors from others food in the fridge. As for me, I rarely keep tea in the fridge. I usually drink my tea hot and brew it fresh each time. I will make cold-brewed tea in the summer.

Yes they can go stale, depends on the typ of tea bags and how you store them, in air tight containers and the amount of heat in your home. You can tell by the smell or the taste of the tea. tea bag's don't go ba,only used up. And you should only use them 3 time's at maximum, after that they don't even smell nice.

These smaller pieces are more prone to oxidation and turning stale. Your best bet is to buy tea bags in quantities that you think you can use up within six months, so that the flavor and aroma remain strong, and before it becomes a bit more stale after one year. Add a note to the container holding the stored teabags when you bring them home, so you know how long to keep them.

Tea leaves may be contaminated with coliform bacteria. If iced tea is brewed at inadequate temperatures or in an improperly cleaned urn, or if it is stored for too long, it may grow coliform bacteria, most frequently Klebsiella and Enterobacter, and less commonly E. coli.
 Source: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060919113500AAQnDwu
Best Answer: Tea bags don't go 'bad' in the way that fresh foods can get bacteria and actually make you sick when they go bad. Tea bags just lose their freshness and quality with time and exposure to light. Generally tea in bags will be at their best within 6 months after you purchased them. To keep them as fresh for as long as possible, keep them in an airtight container out of direct light. I highly recommend that if you really love tea that you try loose leaf tea - the flavour and quality is so much better. Enjoy!

Recommendations for Iced Tea Safety. * Iced tea sould be brewed at 195 F for 3-5 minutes. * Iced tea should be stored for no longer than 8 hours. * The tea brewer, storage dispenser, and faucet should be cleaned daily. The CDC stated that redesigning tea dispensers to be more easily dismantled and cleaned could further reduce the theoretical risk of bacterial contamination of iced tea.

The X-15 holds both speed and altitude records. It was 15.24 meters long and had a 6.7-meter wingspan. The X-15 was developed specifically to conduct research in the fields of aerodynamics and aspects of high-speed and high-altitude flight. It made 199 flights between 1959 and 1968. William Knight holds the record for achieving the fastest speed achieved by an aircraft: Mach 6.7 (6.7 times faster than the speed of sound or 2020 m/s). On August 22, 1963, Joseph A. Walker achieved the highest altitude ever gained by an airplane: 107,900 m (354,200 feet).

Planes equipped with jet engines fly at greater altitudes than propeller-driven aircraft. These include commercial flights, cargo jets and even private passenger jets. The air traffic control tower usually assigns a cruising altitude of up to 39,000 feet, but long flights are typically assigned higher altitudes. By keeping these planes at assigned altitudes, air traffic control creates invisible stacked highways in the sky, keeping enough air space between the flights.

When flying a plane, the pilot needs to know exactly how high above the earth the plane is traveling, a measurement that is called altitude. A pilot keeps track of altitude to ensure the plane is flying high enough to clear any topographical features that are below the flight path. Altitude is also monitored by air traffic controllers to ensure that the planes don’t pass too closely to each other while in flight.

However, the air was so thin and the temperature was so low (12 °F) that they were unconscious when they reached that altitude. In May, 1961, the current official altitude record was set. Commander Malcolm Ross and Lieutenant Victor A. Prather, Jr. of the US Navy rose 113,740 feet (34,668 m). The name of the balloon was USN Strato-Lab V. This flight was part of a program called Strato-Lab which used experimental high-altitude manned plastic balloons. Prather drowned and died after his Strato-Lab V flight. His pressure suit filled with water as he landed at sea after his record breaking flight. Even though the highest altitude was 34,668 meters, according to the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, a zero-pressure balloon is capable of rising to an altitude of 140,000 feet (42,000 m).

Most newborn babies begin to show interest in raising their heads from around two months of age. However, some babies might achieve this milestone earlier or later depending on various factors such as genetics, overall health, and individual developmental pace. Generally speaking, most infants should be able to hold their heads up without any assistance by around four to five months of age.

1 to 2 Months. After the completion of first month, the baby briefly tries to lift his head and turns it side to side during tummy time. It is also observed that coordinated and strong babies (at the age of 6 to 8 weeks) can also raise their head up during tummy time. While being carried on the shoulder, they try to hold and control the shakiness of head but this is not for long time. The babies will also try to hold their heads while sitting in front pack and car seat.

Most of the babies do not require much head support at or around 4 months of age.

The accepted lifespan of the front disc brake pads is roughly 30,000 miles. This can vary greatly though. If you drive the vehicle hard and ride the brakes, the pads may need to be replaced in only 10,000 miles. The rear brake pads should last twice as long as the front disc pads.

A brake rotor is a smooth metal disc attached to the wheel hub. Most new cars (1999 and above) come with rotors at each wheel. Older cars may have drums instead of rotors at the rear wheels. Brake rotors play an important part in the braking system. It is the friction between brake pads and rotors that cause your car to slow down and stop.

If you wish to replace the discs on the front an average price for a set of brake pads is approximately $60.00 - $111.00 but depending on the make and model of your car it could cost a lot more than that.

Both options result in higher long-term mortgage costs than would be the case if you paid for the refinancing out of pocket.

Fundal height. Fundal height is generally defined as the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus measured in centimeters. After the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height measurement often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant. For example, if you're 27 weeks pregnant, your health care provider would expect your fundal height to be about 27 centimeters. It isn't unusual, however, for your fundal height to measure somewhat smaller or larger than expected. This might happen if you: 1  Have a high body mass index.

And although a number of urine culture tests found a variety of different bacteria, only one bug -- Escherichia coli-- was found in both the urine test and the bladder. These findings suggest that today's lab tests may not be refined enough to detect very small quantities of bacteria in the bladder.

Results of the study were published in the Nov. 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Urinary tract infections (also called UTIs or acute cystitis) are common bacterial infections, responsible for about 9 million doctor's visits in the United States every year, according to the study.
 Source: http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/test-urine.html
What It Is. A routine urine culture detects the amount of germs (microorganisms like bacteria) present in the urine. Once a urine sample is collected, a technician will keep it in conditions where microorganisms can multiply. Normally, no more than a small number of germs will be in the urine if there's no infection.
 Source: http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/test-urine.html
(There may be temporary discomfort if a catheter was inserted to collect the urine.) It's important to keep the area around the urinary opening clean before the test and to catch the urine sample midstream. Getting the Results. The results of the urine culture will be available in 1-3 days. Your doctor will go over the results with you and explain what they mean. Risks. No risks are involved when providing a sample for a urine culture.

A urine culture is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI) and see what kinds of germs are causing it. 1  The doctor may order a urine culture if your child: 2  complains of a painful sensation when peeing. 3  feels the urge to pee frequently but doesn't produce much urine (also called urgency)
 Source: https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20131113/urine-tests-dont-always-confirm-urinary-infections-study-finds
When the researchers found E. coli in the midstream urine sample, it was also quite likely that they would find it in the bladder urine, too. However, when other types of bacteria were found in the midstream urine sample, they often didn't correlate to bacteria in the bladder.
 Source: https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20131113/urine-tests-dont-always-confirm-urinary-infections-study-finds
Most women are treated right away for symptoms anyway, because the urine culture doesn't come back for two days, explained the study's lead author, Dr. Thomas Hooton, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida.

However, if the growth of organisms is excessive, it implies a positive urine culture test and is indicative of a urinary tract infection. If the test is positive, then you may need to take some other tests to determine the appropriate treatment or medication to eliminate the infection.

History of Stupas The stupa is the oldest Buddhist religious monument.

Twenty-five-hundred years ago, at the time of Shakyamuni Buddha’s death, a change came about in the way stupas were regarded.

So, the stupa evolved from a mound of dirt (stup, Skt., “to heap up, pile, raise aloft, elevate”), to a king’s burial tomb, to a religious monument. After the Buddha’s death, stupas evolved from being used as shrines to the dead and into places to honor the living. They were erected to remind people far into the future that they, while living, had the seed of enlightenment. A stupa is intended to stop you in your tracks.

It allows for greater flexibility in terms of asset allocation decisions compared to traditional bond funds which typically follow established indices such as Barclays Capital U.S Aggregate Index or Citigroup U.S Treasury Bond Index. Instead, unconstrained bond funds use their discretionary authority granted under their respective prospectuses to select securities based on individual security analysis rather than relying solely upon predefined rules like most indexes do; thus providing additional potential return opportunities beyond those offered by passive strategies via active management techniques employed within these vehicles’ portfolios.

Nonetheless, I would agree that astronomy does not have many practical benefits to people's lives. The reason we do astronomy, I think, is that people are interested in learning about it - humans want to know how the universe came into being, what our place in it is, and what other objects exist within it. Basically, we are curious, and astronomy enriches our lives that way.

Effects of caffeine consumption on nicotine consumption. Kozlowski LT. Coffee-drinking cigarette smokers take in more nicotine when they ingest almost no caffeine than when they ingest an amount of caffeine ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg. They do not take in relatively less nicotine as the dose of caffeine increases from 75 mg to 300 mg. It seems, then, that something due to caffeine deficit is responsible for the effect. Heavier users of caffeine show this effect less strongly than do lighter users of caffeine. These results are discussed in terms of the discriminability of caffeine and nicotine deficits and the possible influence of differential tolerance to caffeine.

The answer isn’t black-and-white, in part because there’s no clear-cut definition of what “bad credit” actually means. For VA loans, borrowers will often need a FICO credit score of at least 620. But the VA doesn’t mandate a minimum score requirement, and credit score benchmarks can vary by lender. Some lenders may be willing to go below that common 620 cutoff, which is considered by some to be the dividing line between “Fair and subprime credit.

Excise Tax. An excise tax is an indirect tax, usually paid by the manufacturer or retailer of the product, then passed along in the price of the product to the consumer. For instance, goods such as cigarettes and alcohol are often taxed by the state or local authority, at a flat rate per item. This tax is added into the retail price, making it somewhat of a hidden tax, ultimately paid by the end user of the product. To explore this concept, consider the following excise tax definition.

Excise tax refers to an indirect type of taxation imposed on the manufacture, sale or use of certain types of goods and products. How It Works Excise taxes are commonly included in the price of a product, such as cigarettes or alcohol, as well as in the price of an activity,often gambling. Excise taxes may be imposed by both Federal and state authorities. Excise taxes usually fall into one of two types: Ad Valorem; meaning that a fixed percentage is charged on a particular good or product. This administration of the tax is less common. Specific; meaning that a fixed currency amount may be imposed depending on the quantity of the goods or products that are purchased. Specific is the most common type. For example, a bottle of wine that normally costs $10 may have a specific excise tax of $2 imposed on it. As per the intent of the excise tax, the additional cost of the wine is passed onto the consumer, making the retail cost of the bottle $12.

As mentioned earlier, active warrants are typically high-priority warrants that require immediate attention due to their serious nature, such as in cases of child abductions, kidnappings, homicides, or armed bank robberies. On the other hand, open warrants are lower-priority warrants that may not be actively searched for by law enforcement officers. However, I hope this general information helps clarify things for you!

Open Warrants. Open warrants are low priority warrants for which police may not actively search for the perpetrator. For example, when a law enforcement officer pulls a driver over for a moving violation, the driver’s name is run through a system to check for warrants. If there are any, the driver is immediately arrested. Under an open warrant, a person cannot renew a driver’s license, travel by air or return through the border.

Best Answer: A bench warrant is one that is usually issued by a sitting judge or magistrate for a person who has missed a court appearance. These are arrest on sight warrants and the subject of these warrants are usually considered flight risks. An open warrant is an arrest warrant that has been issued and not yet returned to the court. In other words, the subject of the warrant has not yet been arrested.

“Yes, protein is also important for recovery after a workout, but research shows that at that point, the body needs fuel with a 4-1 or 5-1 ratio of carbs to protein.” Since most protein powders have at least 20 grams of protein per scoop, you’d need about 80 grams of carbs to go with that scoop to get the proper proportion of nutrients!

The Blade, or lamina, is the broad, flat part of the leaf. Photosynthesis occurs in the blade, which has many green food-making cells. Leaf blades differ from one another in several ways: (1) the types of edges, (2) the patterns of the veins, and (3) the number of blades per leaf. The Types of Edges. Almost all narrow, grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge, as do many broadleaf plants, particularly those that are native to warm climates.

The Patterns of the Veins. Veins carry food and water in a leaf. They also support the blade, much as the metal ribs support the fabric of an open umbrella. In most broad leaves, the veins form a netlike pattern, with several large veins connected by smaller ones. The smallest veins supply every part of the blade with water.

Quick Answer. Parallel venation refers to a pattern in the veins of a leaf where the secondary veins run parallel to each other off of a central, perpendicular primary vein. Parallel venation is also sometimes used to describe a similar pattern on an insect's wing. Venation is a general term for the pattern of veins on a leaf.

Types of Volcanoes. Many people are interested in ways to classify volcanoes. There is probably a natural human instinct to try and give labels to all things. This is not a bad instinct and many times it makes it easier to understand the particular thing that is being classified.

Volcanic plugs: When magma solidifies in the fissure of a volcano the hard dense rock may form a “neck” that remains when softer surrounding rock has been eroded away.
 Source: https://www.livescience.com/27295-volcanoes.html
A volcano is a vent or fissure in Earth's crust through which lava, ash, rock and gases erupt. A volcano is also a mountain formed by the accumulation of these eruptive products. Let's take a look at how volcanoes form: Earth's crust is 40 to 250 miles (64 to 402 kilometers) thick. It is broken up into 14 major and 38 smaller pieces called tectonic plates.

Eruptions at shield volcanoes are only explosive if water somehow gets into the vent, otherwise they are characterized by low-explosivity fountaining that forms cinder cones and spatter cones at the vent, however, 90% of the volcano is lava rather than pyroclastic material.
 Source: http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/book/export/html/198
The lava at strato volcanoes occasionally forms 'a'a, but more commonly it barely flows at all, preferring to pile up in the vent to form volcanic domes. Some strato volcanoes are just a collection of domes piled up on each other.

Shield Volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes on Earth that actually look like volcanoes (i.e. not counting flood basalt flows). The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are the most famous examples. Shield volcanoes are almost exclusively basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted.

Unfortunately, there is one particular volcano classification system that many people think is the only system. Not only is it not the only system, it is not a very good system.

This policy change affected millions of women worldwide who rely on these organizations for access to sexual and reproductive healthcare.
Rolled back the Affordable Care Act: President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. While some provisions were blocked by courts, others remain in place, affecting access to healthcare for millions of American women.
Appointed Conservative Judges: President Trump appointed two Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom are considered conservatives. Additionally, he nominated numerous federal judges, many of whom have been confirmed, further solidifying the rightward shift of the federal judiciary. These appointments could have long-lasting implications for women's rights, particularly regarding reproductive issues.

A current portfolio value represents the overall worth of all holdings within a particular investment vehicle, including any debts or other obligations associated with those holdings. It takes into account both the intrinsic value of each holding as well as how much liquidity there is available should an investor decide to sell some or all of them quickly; this means that if two people have invested $100 apiece into stock XYZ through different brokers then their combined ownership stake would add up to more than simply adding up each individual share’s cost because one might own mostly low-cost shares while another holds mainly high-priced ones – resulting in differences between actual value received upon selling versus expected return based soleately off original purchase prices without considering fluctuating market conditions during periods where neither party had control over management decisions made regarding said stock(s).

 Source: https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/21299/why-cant-helicopters-fly-at-high-altitudes
The real reason helicopters don't routinely fly to those altitudes is that they're not designed to. As with everything in aviation, performance is a trade off between engineering, aerodynamics and commercial pressures. There's a big market for helicopters that can fly up to, say, 12-15,000ft. The market for helicopters capable of rescuing climbers from the top of Everest is, at best, limited, and the technical demands of building a craft routinely capable of such a flight will push the costs up dramatically. In short, they don't because nobody will pay for it.

Failure of an aircraft's components at extremely high altitude is not so much a matter of breakage as it is a failure to function so that flight can continue. The failures are those of lift (by the wings), thrust (from the engines) or control (by flight control surfaces).

{'question': 'deficiency that causes headaches', 'chat_history': []}
There isn't necessarily a single "deficiency" that directly causes headaches, although various nutrient deficiencies may contribute to their development or exacerbation. For example, low levels of magnesium, potassium, calcium, or other essential minerals can affect nerve function and muscle contractions, leading to headaches. Similarly, insufficient intake of vitamins like riboflavin (B2), thiamine (B1), or pyridoxal (B6) has been linked to headache frequency and severity. However, these relationships are complex and multifactorial, involving interactions between dietary factors, lifestyle choices, stress levels, sleep patterns, hormonal fluctuations, medication use, and underlying medical conditions. Therefore, identifying specific causative links between individual nutrient deficits and headaches remains challenging without further research evidence supporting particular associations.

That Phantom Thread would prove sumptuous, and that its costume designer, Mark Bridges, would prove to be one of its handful of MVPs, was to be expected. The rest is a little bit of a shock. In a way, Phantom Thread is like another of this year’s dirtbag-artist movies, Darren Aronofsky’s Mother!, a film that goes out of its way to give male poets a bad name. Phantom Thread’s Woodcock has a contentious streak in him, too, an easily wounded pride to match his devilish talent and charm.

Concentrations of stratospheric ozone represent a balance, established over eons, between creative and destructive forces and this balance, or dynamic equilibrium, has been changed by human activity. Ozone is formed in the earth's stratosphere and is critical to life on earth as we know it. There is compelling scientific evidence that ozone is destroyed in the stratosphere and that some human-released chemicals are speeding up the breakdown of ozone in the atmosphere. CFCs, a human-developed compound, are particularly destructive to the breakdown of ozone in the atmosphere.

It has been around for centuries, and hardly a Greek meal does not incorporate feta cheese in some manner. It is so popular in Greece that very little gets exported. In fact, most of the imported feta cheese comes from Italy. Nowadays, many countries produce forms of feta cheese, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, and of course, the United States. However, modern-day, less robust versions may be made from cow's milk, skimmed milk, or partially-skimmed milk. Feta cheese is classified as a soft cheese made of 45 to 60 percent fat whole sheep's or goat's milk. The better fetas are aged (but not ripened) 4 to 6 weeks, cured in a salty whey and brine.

Nowadays there’s a lot of talk about alkaline and acidic foods and maintaining the body in an alkaline state. Whether the food itself is alkaline or acidic is not the issue but rather how it ultimately affects body chemistry. In simplest terms, our bodies are alkaline by nature but acidic by function.

Alkaline-Acid Food Charts. Scientists can tell how foods will react inside the body by incinerating the food and analyzing the mineral content of its ash. If the mineral content is highly alkaline, then the food will likely have an alkalizing effect on the body, and vice versa. In other words, how the body reacts to certain foods is what determines what foods are alkaline-forming and what foods are acid-forming. For example lemons are acidic in nature, but have an alkalizing effect on the body once they are digested. Similarly, milk is alkaline outside the body, but acidic upon digestion.

Most books that tout the alkaline diet say you shouldn't have alcohol or caffeine, either.
{'question': '________ disparity refers to the slightly different view of the world that each eye receives.cyclopeanbinocularmonoculartrichromatic', 'chat_history': []}
Binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes' horizontal separation (parallax).






***Answer:
Binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes' horizontal separation (parallax).

Sources:
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision
Binocular vision is vision in which creatures having two eyes use them together. The word binocular comes from two Latin roots, bini for double, and oculus for eye. According to Fahle (1987), having two eyes confers six advantages over having one. It gives a creature a spare eye in case one is damaged.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity
Figure 1. Definition of binocular disparity (far and near). Human eyes are horizontally separated by about 50–75 mm (interpupillary distance) depending on each individual. Thus, each eye has a slightly different view of the world around. This can be easily seen when alternately closing one eye while looking at a vertical edge. The binocular disparity can be observed from apparent horizontal shift of the vertical edge between both views.

 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision
Main article: Stereopsis. The overlapping of vision occurs due to the position of the eyes on the head (eyes are located on the front of the head, not on the sides). This overlap allows each eye to view objects with a slightly different viewpoint. As a result of this overlap of vision, binocular vision provides depth.

Binocular Vision - Retinal Disparity. Figure 1-2u. Illustration of the slightly different images the two eyes get of the same thing. The visual system can extract information about depth very successfully and accurately, at least up to about 100 feet. Yet the eyes get two-dimensional images of the visual world.
 Source: http://psych.hanover.edu/Krantz/art/cues.html
All of the other cues to depth are called monocular or one-eye. One such cue, the relative motion of objects at different distances, can be a powerful cue to depth but is unavailable to the painter. Perception of motion requires only one eye and is thus monocular.

These binocular, or two-eye, depth cues require true depth and thus we will not discuss them in context with paintings or drawings. For example, there is the binocular depth cue called disparity. Disparity arises from the fact that our two eyes have a slightly different view of the world. To allow you to see disparity requires either real depth or two images developed as if from different positions like our eyes. This latter approach is illustrated in the photograph from the California Museum of Art.

The images overlap in the center, and the brain connects these together into one seamless view. Thus, Retinal Disparity is the difference between the visual images that each eye perceives because of the different angles in which each eye views the world. Retinal disparity is important for depth perception.

Binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes’ horizontal separation (parallax). The brain uses binocular disparity to extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal images in stereopsis.

{'question': 'alcohol poisoning symptoms day after', 'chat_history': []}
In most cases, alcohol poisoning symptoms will begin within 6 to 12 hours after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. However, some individuals may experience symptoms later than this window, including the day after heavy drinking. These symptoms could include confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, slow or irregular breathing, pale or blue-tinged skin, cold sweats, fainting, seizures, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. Seek immediate emergency assistance if any of these signs persist or worsen over time.

Alcohol Poisoning: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment. When a person has alcohol poisoning they have consumed a toxic amount of alcohol, usually over a short period. Their blood alcohol level is so high it is considered toxic (poisonous). The patient can become extremely confused, unresponsive, disoriented, have shallow breathing, and can even pass out or go into a coma. Alcohol poisoning can be life-threatening and usually requires urgent medical treatment.

Minor symptoms of alcohol withdrawal tend to appear within six to twelve hours of the person’s last drink, sometimes when a person still has a measurable blood alcohol level. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are broken down by the time they’re expected to appear. Symptoms 6 to 12 Hours After Last Drink:

Signs of Alcohol Poisoning. Alcohol poisoning is a step up from a hangover. It is more intense and more dangerous to one's body, and it can occur faster (a hangover is usually experienced the next day, while alcohol poisoning can be experienced around the same time as the alcohol consumption). Alcohol poisoning can also be experienced the morning after the partying.
 Source: http://www.searidgealcoholrehab.com/article-dangers-of-alcohol-poisoning.php
A common cause of alcohol poisoning is binge drinking. Although less common it also occurs when somebody drinks household products containing alcohol. When alcohol, a known toxin, is consumed it is filtered through the liver from the bloodstream. Alcohol is absorbed a lot faster into the bloodstream than food.

Call 9-1-1 or a poison control center to get help ASAP. If it's the next day, you might feel severely dehydrated along with the other alcohol poisoning symptoms. Rehydrate yourself with lots of water (even if you continually vomit it back up), and try to eat something filling. If you have anything beyond mild dehydration and a headache, you need to go to the hospital.
 Source: http://www.highlandridgehospital.com/addiction/alcohol/withdrawal-overdose
The results can be deadly. An alcohol overdose occurs when a person has a blood alcohol content (BAC) significant enough to produce impairments that increase the risk for harm. An overdose on alcohol can range in severity from problems balancing and slurring speech to coma and death.
 Source: http://www.highlandridgehospital.com/addiction/alcohol/withdrawal-overdose
Alcohol overdose is affected by age, drinking experience, sex, the amount of food in the stomach, and ethnicity. As younger people often engage in binge drinking of five or more drinks at one time, this age group is at higher risk for alcohol overdose.
 Source: http://www.searidgealcoholrehab.com/article-dangers-of-alcohol-poisoning.php
In more severe cases of alcohol poisoning the following can occur: choking on one’s own vomit, breathing stops completely or a heart attack. Hypothermia also becomes dangerous as there’s risk of brain damage. Also dangerous are when there are fits or seizures which happen when blood glucose levels drop to low levels. Extreme cases of alcohol poisoning are coma, sometimes leading to death.
 Source: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/215627.php
Hypothermia may become dangerous. If the individual loses too much fluid (severe dehydration) there is a risk of brain damage. If blood glucose levels drop they might have fits (seizures). If the alcohol poisoning is extreme the patient can go into a coma and eventually die.
{'question': 'foods that affect mood', 'chat_history': []}
Based on the provided text, here are some examples of foods that can positively impact mood:
* Asparagus, beans, peas, egg yolks, sunflower seeds, spinach, meat, fish, and poultry, which contain folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. These nutrients can help improve mood by supporting neurotransmitter production and overall brain health.
* Dark chocolate, which contains phenylethylamine, a natural mood elevator.
* Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA, found in salmon, sardines, and fish oil supplements. DHA plays a crucial role in brain development and function, and low levels of DHA have been linked to depression.
* Leafy green vegetables like spinach, which provide iron and vitamin B12, essential for maintaining adequate energy levels and preventing anemia.
On the other hand, here are some examples of foods that could negatively impact mood:
* Refined sugars, such as those found in sweets, baked goods, and processed snacks, which can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and mood instability.
* Gluten, especially if you experience inflammation or an adverse reaction to it, which can impair brain function and reduce energy levels.

CO (carbon monoxide) and CO2 (carbon … dioxide) are the two covalent compounds formed.In addition they can form ions like bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and carbonate ion (CO32-) where there is covalent bond (and not ionic) between carbon and oxygen.onic bonds are formed when there is a strong difference between the electronegativity of the two atoms involved. Also, a metal is almost ALWAYS involved in ionic bonding. In fact, I can't think of any ionic compounds not involving metals.

In chemistry, an ionic compound is a chemical compound in which ions are held together in a structure by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonds.The positively charged ions are called cations and the negatively charged ions are called anions.onic compounds without the acidic hydrogen ion (H +), or the basic ions hydroxide (OH −) or oxide (O 2−), are also known as salts and can be formed by acid-base reactions. Ionic compounds containing hydrogen ions are classified as acids and compounds containing hydroxide or oxide ions are classified as bases.

Ionic Compounds Are Balanced. Table salt is an example of an ionic compound. Sodium and chlorine ions come together to form sodium chloride, or NaCl. The sodium atom in this compound loses an electron to become Na+, while the chlorine atom gains an electron to become Cl-.onic compounds must be balanced-the sum of the positive and negative charges must equal zero. But while the charges of an ionic compound are the sum of their parts, the substance that is formed is quite different. Separately, you would not want to eat sodium as a metal or chlorine as a gas.

4. They conduct electricity well when dissolved in water. This is because the ionic compound is made up of ions, which are all either positively or negatively charged. When the ions are separated in water, they allow the electrons to flow.5. As a solid, ionic compounds are good insulators.xamples of ionic compounds include pyrite, FeS2. Remember that an ionic bond is formed through the transfer of electrons. These compounds are usually formed between metals and non-metals. The ratio of cations to anions is always in a way that there is no net charge.

Ionic compounds are made up of cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions). Ionic compounds generally consist of a metal and one or more non-metals.rite the name of the metal, or the cation.This is the positively charged ion in the compound, and it is always written first in ionic compound formulas. Na is sodium. So, write Sodium.

Lesson Summary. Ionic compounds are compounds made up of ions. These ions are atoms that gain or lose electrons, giving them a net positive or negative charge. Metals tend to lose electrons, so they become cations and have a net positive charge.Nonmetals tend to gain electrons, forming anions that have a net negative charge.onic compounds must be balanced-the sum of the positive and negative charges must equal zero. But while the charges of an ionic compound are the sum of their parts, the substance that is formed is quite different. Separately, you would not want to eat sodium as a metal or chlorine as a gas.

The Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Enlightenment; in French: le Siècle des Lumières, lit. 'the Century of Lights'; and in German: Aufklärung, 'Enlightenment') was an intellectual movement which dominated the world of ideas in Europe in the 18th century.

Published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five volumes, it was compiled by Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond d'Alembert (until 1759), and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers and it helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond.

The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the Academy of Science, founded in 1635 in Paris. It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines, and it trained new scientists.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment
French historians traditionally place the Enlightenment between 1715, the year that Louis XIV died, and 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution. Some recent historians begin the period in the 1620s, with the start of the scientific revolution.

These thinkers valued reason, science, religious tolerance, and what they called “natural rights”—life, liberty, and property. Enlightenment philosophers John Locke, Charles Montesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all developed theories of government in which some or even all the people would govern. These thinkers had a profound effect on the American and French revolutions and the democratic governments that they produced.

Answers from April Chang-Miller, M.D. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fats might help reduce symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. But the research studies supporting this benefit have depended on the test subjects' memories of what they had eaten, which could be faulty. And this type of diet often results in weight loss, which can independently reduce stress on joints and improve arthritis symptoms. Some people have also tried eliminating certain foods from their diets — such as wheat, bacon or pork, milk, rye, beef, or coffee.

Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including:
 Source: https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/joint-pain/5-foods-to-avoid-with-rheumatoid-arthritis.html
In some cases, the inflammatory reaction may also extend to the joints, and this will actually aggravate RA symptoms. According to a study published in 2001 by the Oxford Journal of Rheumatology, 41% of people with rheumatoid arthritis will respond positively to a gluten-free vegan diet.

Nutrition can help, either with medicines or, in some cases, instead of them. Foods affect the joints in two major ways. First, certain foods trigger the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and eliminating these foods sometimes causes even long-standing symptoms to improve or even remit entirely. Second, certain fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory action that can reduce joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.

As things stand now, there has not been an agreement on the most suitable diet for rheumatoid arthritis. Different patients have different levels of tolerance making it difficult for doctors to recommend on a single diet across the divide. But we can highlight five foods that are known to aggravate arthritis symptoms.

Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.
 Source: http://www.pcrm.org/health/healthcare-professionals/nutrition-curriculum/section-eight-nutrition-and-arthritis
Patients whose symptoms do not improve with the diet change may be sensitive to foods other than the common triggers. An elimination diet allows the doctor and patient to identify these culprits. For one week, the diet consists only of the foods that virtually never trigger joint pains (Table 1). Then, if symptoms have abated, the omitted foods are reintroduced one at a time, as described below.

Aspirin Maximum Strength. Uses. Aspirin is used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain from conditions such as muscle aches, toothaches, common cold, and headaches. It may also be used to reduce pain and swelling in conditions such as arthritis. Aspirin is known as a salicylate and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking a certain natural substance in your body to reduce pain and swelling. Consult your doctor before treating a child younger than 12 years.

What is aspirin? Aspirin is a salicylate (sa-LIS-il-ate). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. Aspirin is used to treat pain, and reduce fever or inflammation. It is sometimes used to treat or prevent heart attacks, strokes, and chest pain (angina). Aspirin should be used for cardiovascular conditions only under the supervision of a doctor.

Despite hundreds of clinical trials the appropriate dose of aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke is still uncertain. In the US the doses most frequently recommended are 80 mg, 160 mg, or 325 mg per day. Because aspirin can cause major bleeding, the appropriate dose is the lowest dose that is effective in preventing both MI and stroke because these two diseases frequently co-exist.
 Source: https://www.sharecare.com/health/aspirin/maximum-dosage-aspirin-low-dose
A Stacy Wiegman, PharmD , Pharmacy, answered. The maximum daily dosage for aspirin low-dose is 100 milligrams (mg.). Most aspirin low-dose pills are 81 mg. versus 325 mg. for regular-strength aspirin. If you are taking aspirin low-dose daily, you do not need to take more than 100 mg. for the full benefit. This compares with the other strengths of aspirin in which the maximum daily dosage is 4,000 mg. per 24 hours or 3,900 mg. per 24 hours for controlled-, extended- and delayed-release products.
 Source: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/829921
Many US patients who have an MI are discharged with high-dose aspirin, even though the latest evidence-based practice guidelines support the use of low-dose (81-mg) aspirin, since it is as effective as high-dose (325-mg) aspirin for secondary prevention of MI, with less bleeding risk.
 Source: https://www.sharecare.com/health/aspirin/what-maximum-daily-dosage-aspirin
A Stacy Wiegman, PharmD , Pharmacy, answered. The maximum dosage for over the counter aspirin is 4,000 milligrams total every 24 hours. Aspirin becomes severely toxic if too much is consumed at once, so make sure not to take more than the recommended number of pills at one time. If you are taking aspirin over the counter, follow the directions on the label.

Dosage of Aspirin. For adults doses of 300 to 1000 mg are generally taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with a maximum dose of 4000 mg (4 grams) a day. The correct dose of aspirin depends on the disease or condition that is being treated.

 Source: https://www.ubykotex.com/en-us/periods/period-advice/why-do-i-get-itchy-before-my-period
Sometimes an itchy feeling can occur from changes happening to your body physically and adjusting your routine (body washes, sprays, etc) and/or clothing (sticking with cotton underwear, etc) can help. For some women, simply drinking more water can lessen the itchy feeling.

However, there isn't enough scientific evidence to support these claims. Some studies have shown mixed results, while others have found no association between alkalinity and diabetes management. Therefore, it is crucial to consult a doctor before making any significant changes to your diet.

In addition, an acidic diet is believed (by proponents of the alkaline diet) to lead to a loss of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sodium from the body. Hence, the alkaline diet should be followed to restore the balance and prevent mineral loss.

Watch your protein intake if you partake. Because a high-alkaline diet reduces your intake of meat and dairy products, it is really important to sub in protein-rich foods that are generally considered to be alkaline, like nuts and seeds. As Sass told Health in an interview this week: “It all comes back to balancing.”.

In other words, eating more alkaline foods can't hurt, but the benefits of the diet may not solely be due to your body's pH. There is no one specific alkaline regime. The alkaline diet is more of a theory rather than a specific plan, which can make it a little confusing to follow.
 Source: http://www.diabetic-diet-guide.com/alkaline-diet-and-diabetes/
It is preferably to have a 80/20 mindset about this. 80% should be Highly Alkaline food and 20% could be those who are acid. The less acid and the more procent on the 80 side and less on 20, the better. So a 100% alkaline diet would be great at the beginning but of course, it is not good to be too alkaline either. You need to boost your pH value with eating more alkaline than acid.
 Source: https://www.verywell.com/alkaline-acid-diet-89879
Proponents of the alkaline diet suggest that a diet high in acid-producing foods disrupts the blood's normal pH level and, in turn, triggers the loss of essential minerals (such as calcium) as the body attempts to restore equilibrium. This imbalance is said to increase susceptibility to illness.

The premise behind the alkaline diet dates back, not surprisingly, to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Way back then, the diet consisted largely of fresh fruit, roots, vegetables, and tubers. Things apparently went awry when grains, meats, sugars, and dairy foods were introduced, and the diet became more “acidic.”.

Although the word kit had occasionally been used, and sometimes pup or piglet, most books about mammals just called them `baby' or `young' hedgehogs.

In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands don't make enough of a hormone called cortisol, or less often, a related hormone called aldosterone. That's why doctors sometimes call the illness ''chronic adrenal insufficiency,'' or hypocortisolism. Cortisol's most important function is to help the body respond to stress.

{'question': 'fastest roller coasters in the world', 'chat_history': []}
There are several lists of the fastest roller coasters in the world depending on how one defines "fastest." Here are some examples based on different criteria:
* Maximum speed: According to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), the current fastest roller coaster in the world is Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Dubai, which reaches a top speed of 149 mph (240 kph). Other contenders for this title include Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, USA, and Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld in Gold Coast, Australia.
* Launch system: Some roller coasters use a launch system to accelerate the cars from zero to high speeds in a very short time. Examples of these types of coasters include Kingda Ka and Formula Rossa mentioned above, as well as Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. These coasters can reach extremely high speeds due to their powerful launch systems.
* Hill size/height: Another way to measure the speed of a roller coaster is to look at the height of the lift hill or drop. For example, Kingda Ka stands at an impressive 456 feet (139 meters) tall, making it one of the tallest roller coasters in the world. Similarly, Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld in Australia stands at 377 feet (115 meters) tall. While not necessarily the fastest coasters in the world, these tall structures give riders a thrilling experience due to their sheer scale.

Before Formula Rossa swooped in and claimed the Fastest Roller coaster title, Kingda Ka was, as its name would imply, the king of both speed and height. However, while it may no longer be the fastest, Kingda Ka is most certainly the tallest. Thanks to its massive 456-foot “Top Hat” tower — a hill in the track with a 90-degree ascent and descent — you can see the roller coaster miles away from its location at Six Flags Grand Adventure park.

Kingda Ka is the fastest roller coaster in the United States. It was the fastest coaster in the world for a few years but has since been eclipsed. (It is still the tallest, however.) It's similar to Top Thrill Dragster (although faster), but it feels rougher (at least when I rode it).

The launch mechanism takes the coaster from a standstill to more than 60 km (100 mph) in just two seconds, quickly outpacing the acceleration times of even the fastest commercially available automobiles. By the end of the 1.4-mile course, the coaster tops 150 mph and exerts a staggering 1.7Gs of force on its riders.

Ferrari World, the world’s largest in-door amusement park located in Abu Dhabi, is home to the world’s fastest roller coaster.

A staple food, or simply a staple, is a food that is eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion of a standard diet for a given people, supplying a large fraction of energy needs and generally forming a significant proportion of the intake of other nutrients as well.

Guatemala is now the third largest sugar producer in Latin America, and three quarters of production is exported. Mills are largely controlled by elite landowning families, who together account for 77 per cent of the country's sugar milling. In contrast, coffee is mostly grown by Mayan smallholders.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food
The staple food in different parts of the world is a function of weather patterns, local terrain, farming constraints, acquired tastes and ecosystems. For example, the main energy source staples in the average African diet are cereals (46 percent), roots and tubers (20 percent) and animal products (7 percent).

Farmland, set amongst Guatemala's forested hills. Agriculture provides the backbone of Guatemala's economy, contributing 25 per cent of GDP, employing over half the labour force and providing two thirds of exports, mostly coffee, sugar, bananas and beef. Guatemala's three main staple foods are maize, beans and rice. However, national production covers only 60 per cent of demand, and many poor families face seasonal food shortages. Maize, beans and squash are grown traditionally by the Mayans.
 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food
Staple foods vary from place to place, but typically they are inexpensive or readily-available foods that supply one or more of the three organic macronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Typical examples of staples include tubers and roots; and grains, legumes, and other seeds.

When a shark brushes or bumps their victim first, circles around then attacks, these are known as bump and bite attacks. A sneak attack, however, comes without warning. These attacks are the most violent and occur all of a sudden. Both these attacks often result in major injuries and the occasional death.

1. New Smyrna Beach, Florida: Home to an astounding 238 attacks, this Florida beach consistently records more shark attacks than any other beach. However, despite that alarming number, there has yet to be a fatal attack. Most of the bites are from young bull sharks nibbling for what they think is food. New Smyrna Beach is part of Volusia County, Florida. A very popular beach, many claim that the reason the number of attacks is so high is simply because the number of people in the water on any given day is so high as well.

But reduced function of the right ventricle can also occur in heart failure. As blood begins to back up behind the failing left ventricle and into the lungs, it will become harder for the right ventricle to pump returning blood through the lungs. Like the left ventricle, the right ventricle will weaken with time and start to fail.

In addition, the pressure in the veins of the lung increases, which may cause fluid accumulation in the lung. This results in shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.

Symptoms. People who experience any of the symptoms associated with heart failure, even if they are mild, should consult a doctor as soon as possible. Once a person is diagnosed, it's important to keep track of symptoms and report any sudden changes. Typical signs of heart failure include: Breathlessness or Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea) — When the heart begins to fail, blood backs up in the veins attempting to carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. As fluid pools in the lungs, it interferes with normal breathing.

DON’T overheat. High heat can cause dull color by making the hair cuticles rough. If you can’t air dry, a tourmaline and ceramic grill blow dryer can help smooth cuticles without the damage. Flat irons can dry out hair, so use heat-protective products like sprays and serums to prevent damage.

Hair | Hair Color. Avoid Brassy Hair Color. No one wants their hair color to look brassy. The general rule of thumb is the lighter you make your hair, the more likely it is to turn brassy since the process used to lighten hair opens the cuticle, allowing it to be more susceptible to damaging factors that can alter the color.

DON’T drown your hair. Research suggests that up to 80% of color fade is caused by water alone. Once you shampoo and condition in the shower, avoid letting the water run over your hair. When you do rinse, use lukewarm or cool water—hot water can cause color loss. DO protect your hair from the sun. UV rays fade hair color and dehydrate strands – even during winter months. Shampoos, glazes, and conditioners with SPF can help protect hair from sun damage year-round.

You can dye your hair brown or black by using coffee. Get a rich, dark, unflavored roast and brew an entire pot. Allow the coffee to cool and pour into a basin in the sink. Work the mixture thoroughly through your hair by pouring and massaging it in. Allow the mixture to set for 15 minutes.

The color(s) we see are based upon these chemical bonds and the amount of light that is absorbed in a particular wavelength. Ultraviolet rays can break down the chemical bonds and thus fade the color(s) in an object - it is a bleaching effect. Some objects may be more prone to fading, such as dyed textiles and watercolors. Other objects may reflect the light more, which makes them less prone to fade.

Chlorine can be to blame for brassy hair. “It causes a chemical reaction that counteracts with the actual tone of the color. Most of the time, it leads the hair to appear dull and dry looking,” says Jahanbigloo.

While brassiness is hard to avoid, it isn’t impossible to avert. The sun is the number-one offender for brassy color, as it causes color to fade. That is why you should always keep color-treated locks protected from the sun. A scarf or wide-brimmed hat is an easy, chic way to preserve your color.

African sleeping sickness, also called African trypanosomiasis, is a parasitic infection caused by the bite of an infected tsetse fly (genus 'Glossina'). There are two main types of the disease, one found mainly in west and central Africa (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense) and another primarily found in east Africa (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense). Both types cause fever, headache, joint pain, and swelling of the lymph nodes and spleen, among other symptoms. Without prompt treatment, the disease progresses to a late stage characterized by confusion, slurred speech, weakness, seizures, and eventually death.

Generally known as sleeping sickness, human African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic infection transmitted by tsetse flies. Tsetse flies are found in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, putting 65 million people at risk. The infection attacks the central nervous system, causing severe neurological disorders.

The disease is found in two forms, depending on the parasite, either ''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'' or ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense''. ''T. b. gambiense'' is found in central and western Africa; it causes a chronic condition that can extend in a passive phase for months or years before symptoms emerge.

Instances of sleeping sickness are being reduced by the use of the sterile insect technique. Regular active surveillance, involving case detection and treatment, in addition to tsetse fly control, is the backbone of the strategy for control of sleeping sickness.

Both of these parasites are transmitted to human hosts by bites of infected tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis for T brucei gambiense and Glossina morsitans for T brucei rhodesiense), which are found only in Africa. In West African trypanosomiasis, the reservoirs of infection for these vectors are exclusively human. East African trypanosomiasis, however, is a zoonotic infection with animal vectors.

Carnauba wax is a botanical product used in a large number of industries. Sometimes called the Queen of Wax, it has a much higher melting point than other waxes and is also extremely hard. This makes it ideal for creating extremely strong coatings for floors, automobiles, and other things that see hard wear.
 Source: http://www.humblebeeandme.com/quick-guide-carnauba-wax-liquid-oil-ratios/
I used the same method for this experiment as for the last wax and liquid oils guide. Working with 1g increments, I tested ratios of 1:1 through 1:8, increasing the amount of oil (I used olive oil again), and always using 1 gram of carnauba wax.
 Source: http://www.humblebeeandme.com/quick-guide-carnauba-wax-liquid-oil-ratios/
So, 1:1 was 1 gram of each, while 1:8 was 1 gram of wax and 8 grams of olive oil. I labelled each little tin, melted them one by one in a water bath, and then let them set up for four full days as most sources agree that it takes carnauba wax up to three days to reach its full hardness after being melted.

Although carnauba wax has largely been replaced by synthetics, it is still produced and used in many parts of the world. A Brazilian tree formally named Copernicia prunifera, and otherwise known as the fan or carnauba palm, is the source for carnauba wax. The palm has broad fan-like leaves attached to toothed stalks. In hot, dry weather, the plant secretes wax to protect the leaves from damage.

So, today I’m venturing further into vegan wax territory. Carnauba wax, also called Brazil wax is a plant based wax, derived from the leaves of Copernicia prunifera, a plant that only lives and grows in northeast Brazil.

The special blue light kills the p. acnes bacterium that grows inside clogged pores that swell up and form pimples on the skin.Blue light treatments involve sitting with your face close to the light for a short time (typically 8 to 16 mins 40 secs) about once or twice per week for a period of about five weeks or so.

Enwemeka is leading a research effort in Brazil and at UWM that he hopes will ultimately lead to clinical use of NIR and blue light in the U.S. for the treatment of wounds. In the six years since he was asked to test the effects of blue light on MRSA, he says, research on the topic has picked up. But currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not sanctioned the use of blue light in treating wounds, or NIR light for conditions other than wounds and pain.

PDT using Levulan ( 5-aminolevulinic acid or ALA ) and a proprietary Blue light is currently FDA approved for the treatment of skin pre-cancers called actinic keratosis ( rough scaly spots generally on sun exposed skin in more fair skin individuals). PDT is also known as “ALA/PDT treatment” or “Super Blue Light”. It has been referred to as a “super photo facial” when the photosensitizer is used with a machine called intense pulsed light or IPL. These treatments may help remove sun damaged pre-cancerous zones and spots.

Overdose can cause fatal liver failure. Up to 10% of hospitalisations for overdose and 40% of acute hepatic failure is linked to acetaminophen overdose, which is more often accidental (e.g., children, alcoholics) than intentional (i.e., suicidal). Doses of > 150 mg/kg/24 hours will cause acute liver failure.

Taking too much acetaminophen may cause serious (possibly fatal) liver disease. Adults should not take more than 4000 milligrams (4 grams) of acetaminophen a day. People with liver problems and children should take less acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how much acetaminophen is safe to take.

It is usually taken every four to six hours, as needed; a long-acting formula is taken every eight hours as needed.

Symptoms of PTSD often are grouped into four main categories, including: 1  Reliving: People with PTSD repeatedly relive the ordeal through thoughts and memories of the trauma.  Avoiding: The person may avoid people, places, thoughts, or situations that may remind him or her of the trauma. This can lead to feelings of detachment and isolation from family and friends, as well as a loss of interest in activities that the person once enjoyed.
 Source: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml
Things that remind a person of the traumatic event can trigger avoidance symptoms. These symptoms may cause a person to change his or her personal routine. For example, after a bad car accident, a person who usually drives may avoid driving or riding in a car.

Not every traumatized person develops ongoing (chronic) or even short-term (acute) PTSD. Not everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. Some experiences, like the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one, can also cause PTSD. Symptoms usually begin early, within 3 months of the traumatic incident, but sometimes they begin years afterward. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be considered PTSD. The course of the illness varies.

Yes, I do know the answer! According to the text provided, the most abundant mineral group on Earth is indeed feldspars, specifically those belonging to the plagioclase and orthoclase subgroups. These minerals are characterized by their presence of aluminum and silicon atoms in their chemical formula, along with other elements like sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron.

Plagioclase ((Ca,Na)AlSi 3 O 8) is one of the forms of feldspar. It is an aluminum-containing silicate. This feldspar is distinguished from the orthoclase form by its content of calcium and sodium. The feldspars are the most abundant minerals on the earth. In the Bowen reaction series, plagioclase can be seen to form throughout the process of magma crystallization in what is called the continuous reaction series.
 Source: http://www.ima-na.org/?page=what_is_feldspar
Beneficial properties of feldspars include good dispersability, high chemical inertness, stable pH, high resistance to abrasion, low viscosity at high filler loading, interesting refractive index and resistance to frosting. The products used in such applications are generally fine-milled grades.

Feldspar is what's called a rock-forming mineral, very common and usually making up a large part of the rock. In sum, any glassy mineral that's slightly softer than quartz is very likely to be a feldspar. The main mineral that might be confused with feldspar is quartz. Besides hardness, the biggest difference is how the two minerals break. Quartz breaks in curvy and irregular shapes (conchoidal fracture).

Feldspars are a group of closely related minerals that together are the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. A thorough knowledge of the feldspars is what separates geologists from the rest of us.

Plagioclase Orthoclase. Feldspar is a name given to a class of aluminum-containing silicates which are sometimes called light silicates or nonferromagnesian silicates since they don't contain iron or magnesium. The feldspars include orthoclase (KAlSi 3 O 8) and plagioclase ((Ca,Na)AlSi 3 O 8).

Feldspar is by far the most abundant group of minerals in the earth's crust, forming about 60% of terrestrial rocks. Most deposits offer sodium feldspar as well as potassium feldspar and mixed feldspars. Feldspars are primarily used in industrial applications for their alumina and alkali content.

Feldspar. Feldspar is the mineral name given to a group of minerals distinguished by the presence of aluminum (Al) and the silica ion (SiO4) in their chemistry. This group includes aluminum silicates of soda (sodium oxide), potassium (potassium oxide), or lime (calcium oxide). Feldspar is the single most abundant mineral group on Earth. Together, the varieties of feldspar account for one half of the Earth's crust. The minerals included in this group are orthoclase, microcline, and the plagioclase feldspars. They form in a variety of thermal environments, during the crystallization of liquid rock (magma), by metamorphism of rocks deep in the earth, and in sedimentary processes.
 Source: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Geophys/feldspar.html
This feldspar is distinguished from the plagioclase form by its content of potassium. The feldspars are the most abundant minerals on the earth. Polycrystalline orthoclase is usually light cream to salmon pink in color, although color is not a reliable indicator of mineral type.
 Source: http://geology.about.com/od/minerals/a/aboutfeldspar.htm
How to Tell Feldspar. Feldspars are hard minerals, all of them with a hardness of 6 on the Mohs scale. This lies between the hardness of a steel knife (5.5) and the hardness of quartz (7).
 Source: http://www.ima-na.org/?page=what_is_feldspar
The mineralogical composition of most feldspars can be expressed in terms of the ternary system Orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), Albite (NaAlSi3O8) and Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8). Chemically, the feldspars are silicates of aluminium, containing sodium, potassium, iron, calcium, or barium or combinations of these elements.

To answer the question what body systems are affected by pneumonia and how?. There are several different types of pneumonia. In most cases the lungs will have fluid/phlegm/secretions in them. This will decrease the amount of oxygen that gets into the bloodstream. All the cells in the body need oxygen. So if you don't die from the pneumonia and its not treated, it will affect all the organs and parts of your body by starving them of needed oxygen. Source(s): RRT, EMT

The muscles in your body are connected to your bones by tough, fibrous tissues called tendons. When you move a muscle, the force of this movement passes from the muscle through its associated tendon. The tendon uses this force to initiate movement of the connected bone and associated joint.

Fermented foods are a special group of foods that have gone through a fermentation process, creating a deliciously pickled or strongly flavored condiment, food or drink. Some of the most commonly known food ferments include wine, cheese and pickles.

This mash is then mixed with hot water, and some fermentation begins. After being further treated, the liquid is transferred to a vessel, where yeast is added to the mixture. This yeast “eats” the sugar present in the mash and converts it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. After a few weeks of fermentation and a further period of conditioning, the beer is ready to be filtered and consumed. Wine is created using a similar method that also involves fermentation.

Calcitonin is a hormone that is produced in humans by the parafollicular cells (commonly known as C-cells) of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin is involved in helping to regulate levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood, opposing the action of parathyroid hormone.he secretion of calcitonin is also inhibited by the hormone somatostatin which is also released by the C-cells in the thyroid gland. What happens if I have too much calcitonin? There does not seem to be any effect on the body as a result of having too much calcitonin.

Calcitonin. Calcitonin is produced by the C cells of the thyroid gland and is released when levels of calcium in the blood are increased. Its role is to decrease the amount of calcium in the blood. It has the opposite action to parathyroid hormone, which increases the amount of calcium in the blood when levels fall.hen calcium levels are high, more calcitonin is released from the gland. When calcium levels fall, the release of calcitonin also falls. Some other hormones play a role in the regulation of calcitonin. Somatostatin is a hormone which reduces the release of calcitonin, and gastrin promotes the release of calcitonin.

First, I should say that stating that he has a lesion in his liver only states that there was an abnormality on the scan. Although lesions can be tumors, they can also be infections or areas of trauma. Since the most likely possibility is that his is some kind of tumor, I'll discuss those possibilities below. 1. Cavernous Hemangioma-These are the most common liver tumor and they are benign.

The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver.

Tweet. Liver lesions is a term that can be applied to any of various abnormalities of the liver, including those produced by serious conditions such as liver cancer or cirrhosis but much more commonly those that result from more benign conditions such as cysts or liver hemangioma.
 Source: http://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-basic-information
None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer. They may need to be removed surgically if they cause pain or bleeding. Liver cancers include: 1  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 2  Cholangiocarcinoma (These are really cancers of the bile duct. 3  They will not be discussed in this article.).

Treatment Options for Metastatic Liver Lesions. Once a metastatic liver lesion is detected, patients should undergo a rapid medical, oncologic and surgical evaluation to determine the most appropriate treatment. The treatment may vary between patients, and will be tailored to best fit each individual's specific needs.

Liver Hemangioma. The most common form of liver lesion is liver hemangioma, a benign tumor that normally causes no symptoms and poses no danger. On rare occasions, an especially large hemangioma will cause symptoms such as pain, nausea, or enlarged liver, and may be removed surgically.
 Source: https://www.zocdoc.com/answers/3008/how-common-are-liver-lesions
Symptoms only occur if they become big enough to press on another structure. There is a small risk that they can burst an bleed, but this risk is low unless they are very large in which case they are removed. Otherwise the tumors are left alone. They are not biopsied because of the risk of bleeding.
 Source: https://www.zocdoc.com/answers/3008/how-common-are-liver-lesions
The most common tumor to metastasize to the liver is colon cancer. Some of these can be distinguished just by the imaging, others require biopsy. I would ask the physician who ordered the liver scan which of these possibilities he or she thinks it is. Good luck. This answer is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
 Source: http://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-basic-information
Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells, several types of tumors can form there. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have. The more common benign tumors of the liver include: 1  Hemangioma.
 Source: http://www.hepaticsteatosis.net/liver-lesions.html
Although liver lesions can be a sign of (or consist of) dangerous liver conditions, most of the time they are not a cause for concern. It is disconcerting to find out that an abnormal growth has appeared on such a vital organ as your liver, but it's a common occurrence and not a reason to panic.

There isn't a specific number of golf clubs that every golfer should carry in their bag. Instead, the ideal number depends on each player's individual skill level, playing style, and personal preferences.

Ultimately, the key is to experiment with different combinations until finding the setup that works best for you.

Definition: In golf, forced carry refers to a situation that requires a golfer to hit his golf ball over a hazard in order to advance toward the green. In other words, the golfer is forced to carry a hazard to advance his or her ball.  Carry  refers to the distance a golf ball remains in the air. When a forced carry exists, there is no option to advance the ball through roll, along the ground. The golfer must hit a shot that keeps his ball in the air for enough distance to clear the hazard.

Perched on a hilltop, the hotel is surrounded by trees and an expansive lawn that's actually an 18 hole, executive golf course. We like the property because it's one of the few in Bermuda to have its own, good-sized beach, plus a children's program and an indoor pool.

Beach The Fairmont Private Beach Club is situated on one of Bermuda's finest beaches, a secluded private cove with impossibly pink sand.

There are two complementary mechanisms for achieving open access to research. The first mechanism is for authors to publish in open-access journals that do not receive income through reader subscriptions. The second is for authors to deposit their refereed journal article in an open electronic archive. These two mechanisms are often called the ‘gold’ and ‘green’ routes to open access: 1  Gold – This means publishing in a way that allows immediate access to everyone electronically and free of charge. 2  Green – This means depositing the final peer-reviewed research output in an electronic archive called a repository.

Open access refers to online research outputs that are free of all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs. Two degrees of open access can be distinguished: gratis open access, which is online access free of charge, and libre open access, which is online access free of charge pl

Topping the list of the highest dividend yield right now is Italian oil giant ENI SpA (NYSE: E). It carries a market cap of nearly $70 billion and a dividend yield over the last 12 months of nearly 6.5%. Those dividends have been volatile over the last decade, but the company has been good about tying its dividends to oil prices, so if oil prices recover, investors in ENI would reap the rewards.
